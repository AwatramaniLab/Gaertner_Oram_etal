The following files found at https://zenodo.org/records/12636328 contain the unfiltered cell x gene matrices and their cell metadata files for the 7 coronal sections obtained for this manuscript (labelled Slice A-G). Slices A, E and B were used as the representative images in the figures throughout this manuscript.

Using the code "CodeForMERFISHAnalysis.R" you will be able to load, integrate and analyze the datasets as well as generate the figures that were used in the manuscript. CSV files containing subsets of gene names are provided in this folder.

Updated versions of Seurats "LoadVizgen" and "ReadVizgen" functions were used to create the Seurat objects. These are labelled as "LoadVizgen_opt" and "ReadVizgen_opt" and must be run in R prior to running this code.
